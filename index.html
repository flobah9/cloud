            <h3>What the image does?</h3>
            <p>We choose Ubuntu image. Ubuntu provides a stable and secure foundation 
                for running a variety of applications on your Droplet. Ubuntu comes in different editions, each tailored for specific purposes. On DigitalOcean, 
                you'll likely encounter the Ubuntu Server edition, optimized for running server-side applications. 
                Being open-source, Ubuntu offers a high level of customization. You have full control over the software 
                packages you install and how you configure the system.</p>

            <h3>Why we chose it?</h3>
            <p>Ubuntu is completely free to use and distribute. This makes it a cost-effective option for personal projects or small businesses. 
                The open-source nature also allows for a high degree of customization and access to the underlying code.
                While Ubuntu caters to power users, it has become increasingly user-friendly over the years. The installation process is relatively straightforward, and the desktop
                 environment offers a familiar and intuitive experience for those accustomed to modern operating systems.</p>
